A summer mini project to extract results of delexicalised dependency parsing.
The ML part was done both ways, as in mulitiple models(each for a lexical category eing missed) single test file and vice versa.
Scripts written in python. Uses Stanford Parser to generate models and evaluate test files. Included data files for reference.
